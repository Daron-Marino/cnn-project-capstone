# Proposals

## 1. Satellite Images of Hurricane Damage

[link to data](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/satellite-images-of-hurricane-damage)

* This dataset contains satellite images of Texas after Hurrican Harvey. The images are divided into two classes: `damage` and `no_damage` 
* I'd like to build an image classifaction model that can reliably predict whether the images via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* I'd also like to compare the performance of various CNNs via hyperparameter tuning as well as the performance of another method such as Gradient Boosted Classifiers.
  - I would assess performance by comparing the results of a loss function between each model.

## 2. Face Data (Age, Gender, Ethnicity) Classification

[link to data](https://www.kaggle.com/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv)

* This dataset contains facial images (27,305 rows and 5 columns)
* I'd like to build an accurate CNN model that can predict a person's age, gender, and ethnicity.
  - I would also test varying versions of a CNN along with other models and compare their performance based on a loss function.

## 3. Doom or Animal Crossing?

[link to data](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/doom-crossing)

* This dataset contains 1597 images posts (including metadata) from doom and animal crossing subreddit pages. 
* Similar to the previous two proposals, I'd like to build an image classification model that can reliably differentiate between Doom and Animal Crossing images.
  - I would test various models and compare their performance based on a loss function.
